# BRUHsailer RuneLite Plugin — Project Brief

## What we're building

A RuneLite plugin that turns the BRUHsailer OSRS ironman guide into a guided,
step-by-step side panel inside the game client, with optional automatic step
completion detection and integration with the Shortest Path plugin for navigation.

**Guide source:** https://osrsper.github.io/BRUHsailer/
**Upstream repo:** https://github.com/umkyzn/BRUHsailer (see `/data` folder)
**Guide authors:** So Iron BRUH & ParasailerOSRS. Web adaptation by kyyznn,
improved by Jesper (osrsper). Credit them prominently in the plugin.

## Developer context — read this first

The project owner is **new to Java**. He is not new to software generally —
he has React/Supabase and Google Apps Script experience — but Java, Gradle,
and the RuneLite plugin lifecycle are all unfamiliar.

Implications:
- Explain build errors rather than silently fixing them.
- Prefer boring, readable Java over clever Java.
- Comment the RuneLite-specific lifecycle bits (`@Subscribe`, `startUp()`,
  `shutDown()`, injection) because those are non-obvious to newcomers.
- When something needs to be installed or configured, give exact commands.

## Core architecture

### The data problem

The guide's steps are prose written for humans ("get 43 Prayer, then chin at
MM2 tunnels until 70 Range"). The upstream JSON has an ordered list of steps
with text, but **no machine-readable completion conditions and no coordinates.**

Therefore the design principle is:

> **Annotation is optional everywhere. The plugin is fully usable with zero
> annotations, and gets smarter as they accumulate.**

Unannotated steps fall back to a manual checkbox — exactly how the website
works today. Nothing breaks.

### Two-file data model

1. **Guide data** — ingested from upstream JSON. Treated as read-only.
   Should be refreshable, since upstream regenerates it from a Google Doc
   via webhook.
2. **Annotation overlay** — our own file, keyed by step ID. Holds optional
   `requires` conditions and optional `target` coordinates. Kept separate so
   upstream guide updates never clobber annotation work, and so other players
   can contribute annotations back via PR.

Sketch of an annotation entry:

```json
{
  "stepId": "s1-14",
  "requires": { "skill": "PRAYER", "level": 43 },
  "target": { "x": 3222, "y": 3218, "plane": 0 }
}
```

### Annotation tiers

- **Tier 1 (do this):** skill levels, quest completion, item checks. These
  are stated literally in the guide prose, so write an extraction script to
  generate *draft* annotations, then have the owner review/approve rather
  than author from scratch.
- **Tier 2 (do this, via tooling):** location targets. Do NOT ask the owner
  to look up world coordinates by hand. Build a **"capture location for this
  step" button** into the panel that reads the player's current `WorldPoint`
  and writes it into the annotation file. He annotates passively while
  playing his own ironman.
- **Tier 3 (skip):** varbit-backed state like diary tasks, shortcut unlocks,
  POH rooms. Too much effort to discover. Leave these as manual checkboxes.

The capture button is the highest-leverage feature in the whole project.
Build it early, not as a nice-to-have.

## Shortest Path integration

Target plugin: https://github.com/Skretzo/shortest-path (currently ~v0.3.1)

**Constraint:** Plugin Hub plugins load in isolated classloaders, so you
cannot simply import Shortest Path's classes and call them.

Approaches, in order of preference:

1. **ConfigManager handoff** — write the target into the `shortestpath`
   config group and let its own listener react. No hard dependency; degrades
   gracefully when the user doesn't have it installed.
2. **EventBus** — post an event it subscribes to, if it exposes one.
3. **Vendor the pathfinder** — it's open source. Heaviest option, zero
   runtime dependency. Check the license and honour attribution.

**Verify before building:** read the current `ShortestPathPlugin.java` and
its config class to confirm which config keys it actually listens to. Its
interop surface has changed across versions — do not assume.

Prior art worth reading:
- A Plugin Hub plugin exists that uses Shortest Path to route to clue scroll
  locations — evidence clean integration is achievable.
- `JaredEzz/shortest-path-quest-helper` is a *fork* of Shortest Path that
  auto-targets the next Quest Helper location. The fact it's a fork rather
  than an integration suggests friction on the clean route — read it to learn
  what that friction was.

GPS plugin is an acceptable fallback pathing target if Shortest Path proves
hostile to integration.

**Reference implementation:** Quest Helper is open source and solves most of
the step/requirement architecture problems already. Read its step and
requirement model before inventing one.

## Build order

1. Gradle project scaffold that builds and launches a RuneLite client with
   the plugin loaded (`gradlew run` should Just Work).
2. Ingestion: upstream JSON → internal step model.
3. Side panel: ordered steps, manual checkboxes, search, filter, progress
   bar. Persist progress to the RuneLite profile (not browser localStorage).
   At this point it is already useful — ship-quality on its own.
4. Annotation overlay file format + the location capture button.
5. Tier 1 auto-extraction script + review flow.
6. Shortest Path bridge.

Do not start step 6 before step 3 works end to end.

## Environment setup needed

- JDK (RuneLite plugins target Java 11)
- IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (free)
- Gradle wrapper (committed into the repo, not installed separately)

Plugin Hub distribution eventually requires a public GitHub repo with a
`runelite-plugin.properties` file, but that's a later concern.

## Scope notes

- Owner decision (2026-07-21): the plugin's display name is **IRONSCAPE
  Optimal**. Internal ids (package `com.bruhsailer`, config group
  `bruhsailer`, `~/.runelite/bruhsailer/`) keep the old name on purpose —
  renaming them would orphan saved progress and annotations. BRUHsailer
  guide credits stay prominent.

- Guide has two variants upstream: **Main** and **Landlubber**. Owner
  decision (2026-07-21): ship **Main only**. Everything stays keyed by
  `GuideVariant` so re-adding Landlubber is one enum entry + its JSON.
- Guide is ~1000 steps across three chapters. Panel performance matters —
  don't naively render every step as a live Swing component at once.
